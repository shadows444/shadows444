- 👋 Hi, I’m a maths and physics appassionato and a student of computer engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, videogames and everything that is about computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying software enginering at college.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the future in some high projects, but I am really interesting in creating apps (if you too, send me a message on my IG).
- 📫 How to reach me: You can always send me a message on IG: @lunx_04._
- 😄 Pronouns: My pronous are whatever the fuck you want, he/him. she/ her. they/them, just call me Luna.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My name means moon in Spanish my parents decided to name me like that because the night I was born the lunar phase was full moon.

Another fun fact, the reason I have Petter Griffin has my profile picture is because I love how he always smiles and is happy about everything, despite he is a jackass.
